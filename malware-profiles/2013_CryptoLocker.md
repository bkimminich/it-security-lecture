### Description

CryptoLocker was attached to emails as a ZIP file. The ZIP-file contains an executable programm disguised as a PDF.
Once run, the programm installed itself inside the user directory and made itself run on startup. Afterwards it's attempting to conntect to a server and then generates 2048-bit RSA keys in order to encrypt files across the local hard drives.

In order to get access to your files you had to pay the displayed amount of money via bitcoin or similar pay methods.[^2]
