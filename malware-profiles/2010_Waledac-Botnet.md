### Description
>  **Waledac**, also known by its aliases **Waled** and **Waledpak**, was a [botnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet "Botnet") mostly involved in [e-mail spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_spam "E-mail spam") and [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware "Malware"). In March 2010 the botnet was taken down by [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft"). Before its eventual takedown, the Waledac botnet consisted of an estimated 70,000-90,000 computers infected with the "Waledac" [computer worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm "Computer worm"). The botnet itself was capable of sending about 1.5 billion spam messages a day, or about 1% of the total global spam volume. 
>  For spreading, Waledac sent emails with infiltrated links to a malicious website. Additionally, the mails contained infected attachments like `run.exe` for creating new registry entries.

Additional information about the takedown:
> On February 25, 2010, [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") won a court order which resulted in the temporary cut-off of 277 [domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name "Domain name") which were being used as [command and control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control "Command and control") servers for the botnet, effectively crippling a large part of the botnet.
