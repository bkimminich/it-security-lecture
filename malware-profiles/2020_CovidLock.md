### Description

The CovidLock is a Ransomware that is infecting Android Users. It is distributed via an App that you need to install. If installed and granted administrativ permission, it procedes to lock you out of your device and prompts to send 100$ woth of Bitcoin to a Bitcoinwallet. \[[^1],[^3]\]

CovidLock tries to convince you to activate the device administrative acces by telling you, that it needs these permissions to monitor covid patients and infections nearby. \[[^3]\] 
This is a pretty smart move, as it seems to be a legitimite reason for the permissions. Also the prompt uses the fear of the target against a covid infection to its advantage.
