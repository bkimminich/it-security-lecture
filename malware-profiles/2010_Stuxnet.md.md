### Description
>  Stuxnet is a threat targeting a specific industrial control system (ICS) likely in Iran, such as a gas pipeline or power plant. The ultimate goal of Stuxnet is to sabotage that facility by reprogramming programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to operate as the attackers intend them to, most likely out of their specified boundaries. [^2]
>  
Das Eigentliche Ziel von Stuxnet war jedoch Natanz, eine Iranische Anlage zum Anreichern von Uran. [^1]
> Given the fact that Stuxnet reported IP addresses and hostnames of infected systems back to its command-and-control servers, along with basic configuration data, it appears that the attackers were clearly anticipating (and accepting) a spread to non-combatant systems, and quite eager to monitor it closely – which would eventually also deliver information on contractors working at Natanz, on their other clients, and maybe even about clandestine nuclear facilities in Iran [^1]
> 
Stuxnet ist der erste bekannte Fall einer richtigen "cyber-physical attack", also eines Cyber angriffs welcher auch Physischen Schaden verursachte. [^1]
>In order to achieve this goal the creators amassed a vast array of components to increase their chances of success. This includes zero-day exploits, a Windows rootkit, the first ever PLC rootkit, antivirus evasion  techniques, complex process injection and hooking code, network infection routines, peer-to-peer updates, and a command and control interface. [^2]
>[...]
> In addition their malicious binaries contained driver files that needed to be digitally signed to avoid suspicion. The attackers compromised two digital certificates to achieve this task [^2]
