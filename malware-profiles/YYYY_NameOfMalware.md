### Description

FontOnLake is a new and individual malware family. It is attacking targeted Linux systems, so far mainly in Southeast Asia. The operators are able to gain remote control of infected Linux Systems, to collect credentials and act as a proxy server. However, the operators seem to be cautios about their existence, which they try to hide via a rootkit. So there is currently no further information regarding their true intentions available.[^1]

Technically, the FontOnLake malware consists of three elements: a trojanized application, backdoors, and a rootkit. The trojanized applications are used to load
custom backdoors, rootkits or to perform any other kind of nmalicious activity. Normally, the trojanized applications are legitimate Linux binary files. It is
not yet known how these compromized applications get to the victim.[^1]

There are three backdoors discovered, which serve as the main point of communication for the attackers. All three exfiltrate sshd credentials and the terminal
history to their attackers. Also, since all backdoors have this overlapping functionality, probably not all three backdoors are used at once on a system. It seems like FontOnLake is under constant and professional development, with individualized features.[^1]

The last component, the rootkits, should hide network activity, files in relation with FontOnLake as well as providing fallback backdoors and updates. The rootkit(s) also creeate a virtual file being an intermediate communication element between the trojanized app and the rootkit. Data can be written to and read
from this virtual file and can be exported the used backdoors.[^1]

The ESET Research white paper provides following overview of the FontOnLake's communication:[^1]
