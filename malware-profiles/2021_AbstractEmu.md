### Description

Is a rooting malware for Android, which was disguised as functioning apps, that you could download in the Android Play Store. 
The malware would root the device to gain privileged access to it.
It could then use this root access to further download additional malware. [^1]

It uses code abstraction and anti-emulation checks, hence the name AbstractEmu. [^1]

*Lite Launcher was one of the infected apps*

It is simply activated by first opening the downloaded app, which starts a multilayer flow in the end resulting in a gain of intrusive permissions.
With these, the app can be used to start phishing attacks or gain information about the device users' accounts. [^1]
