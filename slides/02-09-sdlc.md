# Secure Development Lifecycle

:x: Identifying errors in late lifecycle phases makes them more expensive to fix or mitigate. \[[^1]\]

:x: Having an unpublished or informal Secure Development Lifecycle will not be successful. \[[^2]\]

:heavy_check_mark: Security must be embedded into all stages of the Software Development Lifecycle to be effective. \[[^2]\]

:heavy_check_mark: A close connection with the right expert and management drive from the beginning are both mandatory. \[[^3]\]

# Security Requirements

---

#### [Derive Security Requirements from Business Functionality](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Security_Requirements_-_1)

* Gather and review functional requirements
* For each functional requirement derive relevant security requirements
  * Lead stakeholders through explicitly noting security expectations
    * e.g. data security, access control, transaction integrity, criticality of business function, separation of duties, uptime etc.
  * Follow the same principles for writing good requirements in general
    * i.e. they should be specific, measurable, and reasonable

---

#### [Security and Compliance Guidance for Requirements](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Security_Requirements_-_1)

* Determine industry best-practices that project teams should treat as requirements
  * e.g. publicly available guidelines, internal or external guidelines/standards/policies, or established compliance requirements
* Do not attempt to bring in too many best-practice requirements into each development iteration
* Slowly add best-practices over successive development cycles

---

#### Protection Requirements ("Schutzbedarf" :de:) Calculator

* Provides an idea of the expected effort for security topics
* Serves as a starting point for detailed requirements analysis
* Formalizes the "gut-feeling" of business and IT stakeholders

<!-- -->

* Covers all **CIA** triad aspects in a high-level fashion
  * **C**onfidentiality: Information classification, Compliance requirements
  * **I**ntegrity: Authentication mechanism, Compliance requirements

# [Secure Design Principles](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Security_by_Design_Principles)

|                               |                               |
|:------------------------------|:------------------------------|
| Minimize Attack Surface Area  | Don't trust Services          |
| Establish Secure Defaults     | Separation of Duties          |

| Principle of Defense in Depth | Keep Security simple          |
| Fail securely                 | Fix Security Issues correctly |

---

## Minimize Attack Surface Area

* **Every feature** that is added to an application **adds a certain amount of risk** to the overall application
* The aim for secure development is to **reduce** the overall risk by reducing **the attack surface area**

---

## Establish Secure Defaults

* The **"out-of-box"** experience for the user **should be secure**
* It should be up to the user to reduce their security - if they are allowed

---

## Principle of Least Privilege

* Accounts have the **least amount of privilege required** to perform their business processes
* This encompasses user rights and resource permissions, e.g.
  * CPU limits
  * memory
  * network
  * file system

---

## Principle of Defense in Depth

* Where one control would be reasonable, **more controls that approach risks in different fashions** are better
* In-depth-controls can make severe vulnerabilities extraordinarily difficult to exploit

---

## Fail securely

* Whenever a transaction fails or code execution throws an exception it should **always "fail closed"** and never "fail open"

---

## Don't trust Services

* Third party partners more than likely have differing security policies and posture
* Implicit **trust of externally run systems is not warranted**
* All external systems should be treated in a similar fashion

---

## Separation of Duties

* Separation of duties is a key **fraud control**
* **Administrators should not also be users** of an application they are responsible for

---

## Avoid Security by Obscurity

* Security through obscurity is a weak security control, and nearly always fails when it is the only control
* The **security** of key systems **should not be reliant upon keeping details hidden**

---

## Keep Security simple

* **Attack surface and simplicity go hand in hand**
* Prefer straightforward and simple code over complex and over-engineered approaches
* Avoid the use of double negatives and complex architectures when a simpler approach would be faster and simpler

---

## Fix Security Issues correctly

* Once a security issue has been identified, it is important to develop a test for it, and to **understand the root cause** of the issue
* It is likely that the security issue is widespread amongst all code bases, so **developing the right fix without introducing regressions** is essential

# Security Testing

---

## Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

> Static application security testing (SAST) is a set of technologies designed to analyze application source code, byte code and binaries for coding and design conditions that are indicative of security vulnerabilities. SAST solutions analyze an application from the “inside out” in a nonrunning state. \[[^6]\]

[^6]: https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/static-application-security-testing-sast

---

# :muscle: [Strengths of SAST](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools)

* Scales well - can be run on lots of software, and can be run repeatedly (as with nightly builds or continuous integration)
* Useful for things that such tools can automatically find with high confidence, such as buffer overflows, SQL Injection Flaws, and so forth
* Output is good for developers - highlights the precise source files, line numbers, and even subsections of lines that are affected

---

# :-1: [Weaknesses of SAST](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools)

* Many types of security vulnerabilities are very difficult to find automatically (<small>e.g. authentication problems, access control issues, insecure use of cryptography, etc.</small>)
* Cover only a relatively small percentage of application security flaws
* High numbers of false positives
* Cannot find configuration issues not represented in the code
* Difficult to _prove_ that an identified security issue is an actual vulnerability

# Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

> Dynamic application security testing (DAST) technologies are designed to detect conditions indicative of a security vulnerability in an application in its running state. Most DAST solutions test only the exposed HTTP and HTML interfaces of Web-enabled applications; however, some solutions are designed specifically for non-Web protocol and data malformation (for example, remote procedure call, Session Initiation Protocol \[SIP\] and so on). \[[^7]\]

# Security Logging & Monitoring

---

# Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

* Exploitation of **insufficient logging and monitoring is the bedrock of nearly every major incident**
* **Attackers** rely on the lack of monitoring and timely response to **achieve their goals without being detected**
  * Most successful attacks start with vulnerability probing
  * Allowing such probes to continue can raise the likelihood of successful exploit to nearly 100%

---

# Examples of Insufficiencies

* Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value transactions are not logged
* Warnings and errors generate no, inadequate, or unclear log messages
* Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for suspicious activity
* Logs are only stored locally
* Appropriate alerting thresholds and response escalation processes are not in place or effective
* Penetration testing and scans by automated tools do not trigger alerts
* The application is unable to detect, escalate, or alert for active attacks in real time or near real time

---

---

# Prevention

* Ensure all login, access control failures, and server-side input validation **failures can be**
  * **logged with sufficient user context** to identify suspicious or malicious accounts
  * **held for sufficient time** to allow delayed forensic analysis
* Ensure that logs are generated in a format that can be easily consumed by a **centralized log management solution**
  * e.g. [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/products) (Kibana, Elasticsearch, Logstash & Beats)

---

* Ensure **high-value transactions have an audit trail** with integrity controls to prevent tampering or deletion
  * e.g. append-only database tables or similar
* Establish effective monitoring and alerting such that **suspicious activities are detected** and responded to **in a timely fashion**
* Establish or adopt an incident response and recovery plan
